                <h1>Our Mandate</h1><br><br><br>
                <article>The Department of Education was established through the Education Decree of 1863 as
                     the Superior Commission of Primary Instruction under a Chairman. The Education agency
                      underwent many reorganization efforts in the 20th century in order to better define its
                       purpose vis a vis the changing administrations and charters. The present day Department of
                        Education was eventually mandated through Republic Act 9155, otherwise known as the Governance
                         of Basic Education act of 2001 which establishes the mandate of this agency.<br><br>
                    The Department of Education (DepEd) formulates, implements, and coordinates policies, plans,
                     programs and projects in the areas of formal and non-formal basic education. It supervises all
                      elementary and secondary education institutions, including alternative learning systems, both
                       public and private; and provides for the establishment and maintenance of a complete, adequate,
                        and integrated system of basic education relevant to the goals of national development.
