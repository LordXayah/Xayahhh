                <h1>General Academic Strand</h1>
                <article>Senior high school (SHS) aims to prepare students with the skills and competencies they need for their desired
                     college courses. This is why many SHS students choose to take up strands that have specialized subjects. However, 
                     there will always be students who are still undecided about what they will be taking up at the tertiary level and 
                     what career they want to pursue. That's why the GAS strand in SHS in the Philippines was designed.<br><br>
                    The GAS strand is created to cater to students who prefer a broader range of studies rather than specific fields. It 
                    offers SHS students the flexibility to choose electives from various strands, which helps in choosing a university degree.
                     This article provides an overview of this strand including some courses that they can take for successful career paths in
                      the future.
